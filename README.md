# devops-resume-pipeline
This repository hosts an automated CI/CD pipeline for managing and sharing my professional resume. The pipeline converts my resume from Word format to both HTML and PDF and deploys the HTML version to an AWS S3 bucket configured as a static website. This setup allows for easy access and download of my resume in multiple formats.
